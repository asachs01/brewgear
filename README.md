# Brew Gear
A list of brew gear that I wish I would have bought, or wish someone would have told me to buy when beginning my homebrewing journey. Note that this is aimed for beginning brewers and is pretty much everything that you'll need and a link of where to buy it. This setup is definitely _NOT_ the most cost-optimized. There are a few things that I've ended up on the cheaper side of (namely the brewhaus elements). However, I've opted to include kegging gear here as I've come to really hate bottle conditioning/carbonating. If you're looking for some more advanced stuff, I'll have that up soon.

## General
* [Starsan sanitizer][1]
* [Hydrometer for measuring beer gravity][2]
* [Whirfloc tablets (optional, good to have on hand for getting clearer beer)][3]
* [Auto siphon for transferring beer + some hose for it][12] (you'll likely have better luck at a local homebrew store)
* [Carboy cleaning brush/scrubber][13]
* [Thermometer][14]

## Cooking
* [4 gallon stock pot][4] (you'll want a second one if you decide to do all grain as a hot liquor tank for sparge water, but I'd just stick with extract as a beginner)

***NOTE***: Ideally, you'd have some sort of cooling device here like an immersion, counterflow or plate chiller. However, this setup is designed for small (1gal) batches, which you can easily get down to temp in a sink full of icewater. 

## Fermenting
* [2 gallon plastic fermenter with drilled lid + 3 piece airlock][5]
* [1 gallon glass carboy][6]

## Dispensing
* [Torpedo Keg (needs a regulator, tap, and C02(below))][7] OR [Cannonball Keg(complete system)][8]
* [CO2 regulator][9]
* [C02 cartriges][10]
* [Snap tap][11]

## Books 

Pretty much [every book on this list][15]. You'll especially want to start off with Palmer's "How to Brew." "The Complete Joy of Homebrewing" is also great. As you get more into brewing the Yeast, Water, Malt and Hops books are a must and they're a wealth of information.
